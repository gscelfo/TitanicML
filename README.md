# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
This is my Python code (Jupyter Notebook) for the Kaggle competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
The aim of the competition is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 
This notebook contains recipies for data elaboration (tackling missing values, categorical variables, etc.) and exploration over different ML models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines) to find the most appropriate one for this problem.
Gradient Boosted Decision Trees provide the best results in term of accuracy (around 80%), whereas a similar outcome is provided also by Kernelized Support Vector Machines after a careful tuning of regularization and kernel width parameters.
